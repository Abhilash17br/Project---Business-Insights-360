## Key Insights:

*Checking at weekday, Weekend Table For ADR, RevPAR,Occupancy%,we could conclude that overall hotels are not changing the price between weedays and weekends.
There is an Potential Oppurtunity to generate income, by changing Price between weekday and weekends, which most of the hotels have not adopted.*

*The Fluctuation in ADR remains same over the time which is directly proportional to pricing ,Occupancy % is seen increasing Marginally,Revpar varies in linear with Occupancy % . This shows that the revenue growth over time is only due to its increase in occupancy %, and price for most of the hotels over time is almost constant, this could be an oppturnity to increase revenue through pricing*

*occupancy %  is directly proportional to Average Ratings of the Hotel, and inversely Proportional with Pricing. Hotels with less Occupancy should work on its Ratings.*

*Relization provides the details of conversion rates form booking to checkin, if the relization is low,it could be that customer is not pleased with apperance of the hotel as when compared to bokking it online.*
