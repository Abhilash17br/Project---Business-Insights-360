The most helpful measures for senior management are the Gross Margin and Net Profit (Gross Margin - Operational Costs).
View of building sales
Gross Margin and Net Sales (Revenue) are more significant to the sales team than Net Profit since, in most cases, they have little to no control over operating costs.
Building Marketing Perspective:
Understanding the changes in marketing spend over time and how those changes affect revenue and gross margin is crucial for the marketing team.
Chain of Supply in Construction:
Forecast Accuracy & Risk (Out of Stock or Excess Inventory) and Net Error & Absolute Error are crucial KPIs for the supply chain team.
Executive Perspective of the Building:
1. One of the most helpful abilities that aids in the creation of insightful visuals is the managing of stakeholder expectations.
2. During our feedback session, the executives instructed me to create a table outlining the key insights for each zone along with the associated risk.
In order to stay in touch with the Executives and receive their input on the Visualizations, information and help pages were also established.

# Thank you.
